  abstract  = {Co-scheduling techniques are used to improve the throughput of applications on chip multiprocessors (CMP), but sharing resources often generates critical interferences. We focus on the interferences in the last level of cache (LLC) and use the Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) recently provided by Intel to partition the LLC and give each co-scheduled application their own cache area. We consider m iterative HPC applications running concurrently and answer the following questions: (i) how to precisely model the behavior of these applications on the cache partitioned platform? and (ii) how many cores and cache fractions should be assigned to each application to maximize the platform efficiency? Here, platform efficiency is defined as maximizing the performance either globally, or as guaranteeing a fixed ratio of iterations per second for each application. Through extensive experiments using CAT, we demonstrate the impact of cache partitioning when multiple HPC application are co-scheduled onto CMP platforms.},

  abstract  = {This work presents a realistic performance model to execute scientific workflows on high-bandwidth-memory architectures such as the Intel Knights Landing. We provide a detailed analysis of the execution time on such platforms, taking into account transfers from both fast and slow memory and their overlap with computations. We discuss several scheduling and mapping strategies: not only tasks must be assigned to computing resources, but also one has to decide which fraction of input and output data will reside in fast memory and which will have to stay in slow memory. We use extensive simulations to assess the impact of the mapping strategies on performance. We also conduct experiments for a simple 1D Gauss-Seidel kernel, which assess the accuracy of the model and further demonstrate the importance of a tuned memory management. Our model and results lay the foundations for further studies and experiments on dual-memory systems.},

  abstract  = {Cache-partitioned architectures allow subsections of the shared last-level cache (LLC) to be exclusively reserved for some applications. This technique dramatically limits interactions between applications that are concurrently executing on a multicore machine. Consider n applications that execute concurrently, with the objective to minimize the makespan, defined as the maximum completion time of the n applications. Key scheduling questions are: (i) which proportion of cache and (ii) how many processors should be given to each application? Here, we assign rational numbers of processors to each application, since they can be shared across applications through multi-threading. In this paper, we provide answers to (i) and (ii) for perfectly parallel applications. Even though the problem is shown to be NP-complete, we give key elements to determine the subset of applications that should share the LLC (while remaining ones only use their smaller private cache). Building upon these results, we design efficient heuristics for general applications. Extensive simulations demonstrate the usefulness of co-scheduling when our efficient cache partitioning strategies are deployed.},

  abstract  = {Recently, the benefits of co-scheduling several applications have been demonstrated in a fault-free context, both in terms of performance and energy savings. However, large-scale computer systems are confronted to frequent failures, and resilience techniques must be employed to ensure the completion of large applications. Indeed, failures may create severe imbalance between applications, and significantly degrade performance. In this paper, we propose to redistribute the resources assigned to each application upon the striking of failures, in order to minimize the expected completion time of a set of co-scheduled applications. First, we introduce a formal model and establish complexity results. When no redistribution is allowed, we can minimize the expected completion time in polynomial time, while the problem becomes NP-complete with redistributions, even in a fault-free context. Therefore, we design polynomial-time heuristics that perform redistributions and account for processor failures. A fault simulator is used to perform extensive simulations that demonstrate the usefulness of redistribution and the performance of the proposed heuristics.},
